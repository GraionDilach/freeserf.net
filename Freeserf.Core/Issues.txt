Map Rendering:

- Black lines / artifacts (fixed by virtual screen resolution change but some small remain)
- Some tiles appear/disappear/change location while scrolling (at certain offsets)
- Some terrain types seem dislocated


Viewport:

- Possible builds symbols do not match 100% the map cursor sprite symbol
- Building possibilities are wrong in some locations (e.g. building on mountain, flag on tree, etc)
- In some zoom levels (I guess not factor 2^n), their are artefacts in map tiles and map object sprites


Non-working code:

- Fix special click (seems to not work)
- Popup box closing only with ESC? Not with a click outside?
- Same enemy can occur more than once in random games
- Player values are not visible in GameInitBox


AI:

- If linking diconnected flags, a flag may be used to connect to castle/stock that is very far away instead of a closer one
- Linking flags may also allow for placing flags one pathes and merging pathes to a near flag
- Spots for lumberjack, stonecutter and sawmill are not really good in most cases
	- The spot should be dependent on the resources and not on the base flag


Serf rendering:

- Serfs sometimes disappear (see RenderSerf.cs comments for details)
- Serfs appear in front of map objects when they should not (e.g. in front of a tree top)
- In rare cases there is an idle serf on top of the castle. Is he not deleted properly?


Notification Box:

- Test too long for:
	FoundStone
    MineEmpty
    OneHourSinceSave
    UnderAttack
- Chaos for:
    LostBuildings
    LostLand


Misc:

- Materials at building constructions are hidden by the building shadow (this is realistic, but is this wanted? How was it done in original game?)
