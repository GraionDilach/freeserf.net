Map Rendering:

- Black lines / artifacts
- Scrolling map is shaky
- Some tiles appear/disappear/change location while scrolling
- Some terrain types seem dislocated
- Scrolling along the map origin (y-axis) leads to jumps
- Building and flag locations not completely right
- Map objects appear at multiple locations
