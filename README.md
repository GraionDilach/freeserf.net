# freeserf.net
freeserf.net is a C# port of [freeserf](https://github.com/freeserf/freeserf).

At the moment there is still a lot of work to do.


## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Porting

The first step is to port everything from C++ to C# and ensure that the game runs.
There may be some quick&dirty implementations or things that could be done better.

### Phase 2: Optimizing

This includes bug fixing and C#-specific optimizations.
Moreover this includes performance and stability optimizations if needed.
Also the plan is to make everything cross-plattform as much as possible.

### Phase 3: Extending

This includes:

- New features
- Better usability
- Other things like mod support, tools and so on


## Future Goal

At the end this should become a stable and performant game that runs on many platforms and can be easily compiled and extended by .NET developers.

I am not sure how far this project will go as my time is very limited. I can not promise anything at this point.
