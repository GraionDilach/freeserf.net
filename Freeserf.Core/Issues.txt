Map Rendering:

- Black lines / artifacts (fixed by virtual screen resolution change but some small remain)
- Map objects may appear above a construction site. Should those objects not be removed?
- Improve grid drawing in minimap
- Roads are not at the right location. Sometimes even a bit inside water. Maybe the tiles below are not at the right pos?
	- The relation between road segments is ok though


Non-working code:

- Sometimes a road can not be build in a direction where it should be possible
- Map clicks are not always considered or at the right spot/tile
- Sometimes road building is strange. No road is built in direction but then 2-3 at once.
- OtherEndDir not valid exception in Serf.cs line 2801. I guess the CallTransporter call in Flag.cs line 864 is the problem. Direction and/or IsWaterPath are not right.
  Maybe this is also the cause for sailors instead of transporters sometimes.
- Minimap clicks are only sometimes right (at least the map movement)
- Text color must be changeable (at least from green to black)
- Burning sprites look awkward
- There is only the text "Emergency Program" instead of "Emergency Program Active"


AI:

- If linking diconnected flags, a flag may be used to connect to castle/stock that is very far away instead of a closer one
- Linking flags may also allow for placing flags on pathes and merging pathes to a near flag
- Only build new buildings if there are enough resources and the essential buildings are in progress or finished


Serf rendering:

- Serfs sometimes disappear (see RenderSerf.cs comments for details), maybe Serf.SwitchWaiting and following code is the problem
	- Now it seems that if two serfs are on the same map pos but serf switching on a road seems to work
- Serfs appear in front of map objects when they should not (e.g. in front of a tree top)
- In rare cases there is an idle serf on top of the castle. Is he not deleted properly?
- I saw a serf using a boat on a normal road when transporting stuff. The idle animation was of a normal transporter. :D
	- As other serfs can walk there too it must be an error with the animation index
	- Saw it again. Two with a boat and one normal transporter one a very small road (where only one transporter could be). They even block each other. It's a bug.
- If a serf runs around a big building (like castle) his head and later the body will disappear even if there is nothing to see from the building there
- When a stonecutter takes a piece of a bigger rock the remaining rock will shortly "jump" like the y coordinate is wrong for a short period of time


Logic:

- Saw a builder that doesn't find the correct way (he runs in a cycle). Is this due to pathfinder time limitation?


Notification Box:

Test again because font char gaps should be smaller now!

- Text too long for:
	FoundStone
    MineEmpty
    OneHourSinceSave
    UnderAttack
- Chaos for:
    LostBuildings
    LostLand


Misc:

- Materials at building constructions are hidden by the building shadow (this is realistic, but is this wanted? How was it done in original game?)
- The castle shadow looks weird and hides serfs that move along the right castle side
