Map Rendering:

- Improve grid drawing in minimap?
- There are still some black artifacts sometimes. It seems this is only true for one tile type (grass) and one slope type (a triangle pointing down right).
  It is not affected by zoom or map scrolling so I guess it is a problem with the graphic/shader/index/mask itself. Maybe a mismatch in graphic and mask index.


Non-working code:

- Sometimes a road can not be build in a direction where it should be possible (maybe this is due to wrong map position calculation)
- Map clicks are not always considered or at the right spot/tile
- Sometimes road building is strange. No road is built in direction but then 2-3 at once.
- Minimap clicks are only sometimes right (at least the map movement)


AI:

- If linking diconnected flags, a flag may be used to connect to castle/stock that is very far away instead of a closer one
- Linking flags should also allow for placing flags on paths and merging paths to a near flag
- Finding minerals and mine spots is not good yet. The search spots should change from time to time but
  changing doesn't mean putting hundreds of flags at the same mountain.
- Fishers are built without water (should not happen).
- Sometimes unlimited geologists are sent out to look for minerals.


Logic:

- Saw a builder that doesn't find the correct way (he runs in a cycle). Is this due to pathfinder time limitation?
  This happens often. Some roads can not be used I guess. Something in the serf logic does not work correctly. Or the path finding is bugged.
- Also happened for a group of knights that always took the wrong path and could not get to a hut.
- With increased game speed the AI is much faster than the game (e.g. buildings and roads are already built before the first serf leaves the castle).
  Maybe the long tick time at the start will not notice the game speed increase and therefore wait long for the next update cycle. This seems right as the game will then run smoothly.
- If a flag is full of resources and the transporters too, they won't exchange the resources at the flag and so there is a deadlock.


Notification Box:

Test again because font char gaps should be smaller now!

- Text too long for:
	FoundStone
    MineEmpty
    OneHourSinceSave
    UnderAttack
- Chaos for:
    LostBuildings


Missing stuff:

- bird sounds
- spectators must be able to view all players (building stocks etc) or must be able to select a player
	- building stocks works now but the statistics and settings are only for player 1
- multiplayer
	- multiplayer should support coop mode (one player is played by two or more clients)
- button to merge roads to a flag


TODO:

- Finish game saving/loading
- Check/improve map position selection (clicks, minimap clicks, centering)
- Finish AIs
- Finish rendering of fighting serfs (additional serf stuff)
- Finish rendering of all additional stuff for all buildings (only mine elevator drawing is not perfect yet)
- Add more game options (like tutorial, multiplayer games or AI vs AI)
- Improve/fix sound
- Look through all TODO code comments and resolve them
- Bugfixing (important is the serf logic which seems to be very bugged in some situations)
- Remove unused code and improve bad code
- Adjust and limit all values properly (like max speed increase and so on)
- Check if all shortcuts/keystrokes work as expected (if not implement them)
- Add new features / improve usability (more infos in UI, better menus, indicators like "how many trees are left for a lumberjack" or even a visual search area if the building is selected)
- Localization (texts should be of the right language later)


Exceptions:

- When a knight wins a fight there is often a bad torso sprite index
- If not debugging there is sometimes an exception in PopupBox.DrawResourceDirectionBox ("Not a knight among the castle defenders.")
