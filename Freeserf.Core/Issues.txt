Map Rendering:

- Black lines / artifacts (fixed by virtual screen resolution change but some small remain)
- Some tiles appear/disappear/change location while scrolling (at certain offsets)
- Some terrain types seem dislocated


Viewport:

- Possible builds symbols do not match 100% the map cursor sprite symbol
- Building possibilities are wrong in some locations (e.g. building on mountain, flag on tree, etc)
- In some zoom levels (I guess not factor 2^n), their are artefacts in map tiles and map object sprites


Non-working code:

- Fix special click (seems to not work)
- Popup box closing only with ESC? Not with a click outside?


Serf rendering:

- Serfs sometimes disappear (see RenderSerf.cs comments for details)
- Serfs appear in front of map objects when they should not (e.g. in front of a tree top)
- In rare cases there is an idle serf on top of the castle. Is he not deleted properly?


Notification Box:

- Test too long for:
	FoundStone
    MineEmpty
    OneHourSinceSave
    UnderAttack
- Chaos for:
    LostBuildings
    LostLand


Misc:

- Materials at building constructions are hidden by the building shadow (this is realistic, but is this wanted? How was it done in original game?)
